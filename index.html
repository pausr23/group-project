      <h2>The Evolution of Artificial Intelligence in Recent Years</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="section-body">
      <p>In the last decade, artificial intelligence has made significant progress. It has moved from being just a theoretical idea or experimental concept to having real applications in today’s world. In recent years, technological advances have made it possible to implement and integrate AI into the software development process.</p>
      <p>One of the key factors behind this progress has been the growth in computing power and the large amount of data now available. Thanks to cloud computing and more powerful tools like GPUs and TPUs, AI systems can now analyze huge amounts of data and learn from them with greater accuracy. This has allowed many developers to use AI in their daily work.</p>
      <p>Another major milestone was the creation of models like OpenAI’s GPT and Google’s BERT. These models greatly improved the way machines understand and generate human language. As a result, there are now tools that can write code, summarize text, or help find bugs in programs.</p>
      <p>A very important recent development is generative AI, which can create content such as text, images, or even code. One example is GitHub Copilot, which helps developers code faster and with less effort by automating repetitive tasks. However, along with these advancements, concerns have also grown about the responsible use of AI, especially when it comes to ethics or the risks of over-relying on these tools.</p>
      <p>In short, AI is no longer just an academic topic, it is now a key part of software development. Its evolution has been fast, and all signs point to continued growth in the coming years.</p>
