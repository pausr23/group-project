    <div class="section-body">
      <p>In the last decade, Artificial Intelligence has made significant progress. It has moved from being just a theoretical idea or experimental concept to having real applications in today’s world. In recent years, technological advances have made it possible to implement and integrate AI into the software development process.</p>
      <p>One of the key factors behind this progress has been the growth in computing power and the large amount of data now available. Thanks to cloud computing and more powerful tools like GPUs and TPUs, AI systems can now analyze huge amounts of data and learn from them with greater accuracy. This has allowed many developers to use AI in their daily work.</p>
      <p>Another major milestone was the creation of models like OpenAI’s GPT and Google’s BERT. These models greatly improved the way machines understand and generate human language. As a result, there are now tools that can write code, summarize text, or help find bugs in programs.</p>
      <p>A very important recent development is generative AI, which can create content such as text, images, or even code. One example is GitHub Copilot, which helps developers code faster and with less effort by automating repetitive tasks. However, along with these advancements, concerns have also grown about the responsible use of AI, especially when it comes to ethics or the risks of over-relying on these tools.</p>
      <p>In short, AI is no longer just an academic topic, it is now a key part of software development. Its evolution has been fast, and all signs point to continued growth in the coming years. As Russell and Norvig (2009, p.1) explain, "The field of artificial intelligence, or AI, goes further still: it attempts not just to understand but also to build intelligent entities.”</p>

        <h2>Generative AI in Software Development</h2>
        <h3 class="author">By Nahomi Lawrence</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section-body">
      <p>As Gallardo and Morales (2024) state, “Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that studies how to build intelligent agents capable of perceiving their environment, reasoning, learning from it, and acting accordingly” (p. 145).This discipline has had a significant impact on the processes associated with software development and has completely transformed the way developers learn, write, maintain, and optimize code.</p>
      <p>Among the various branches of AI, one of the subfields that has attracted the most attention is Generative Artificial Intelligence "Gen AI." As Gallardo and Morales (2024) explain, this area of AI is based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Large Language Models (LLMs), which allow machines to learn from textual information and images to subsequently create unique content.</p>
      <p>Popular tools like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Gemini, CodeWhisperer, or custom models based on LLMs are redefining both professional practice and the way programming is learned. These tools have revolutionized the way software is developed. According to Ramos, Pavajo, and Villanueva (2025), they can interpret natural language prompts and translate them into code suggestions, even in complete programs. Additionally, they support working in multiple programming languages, such as JavaScript, Python, and C++. For these reasons, the use of Generative AI represents an improvement in the efficiency of application development compared to traditional methods.</p>
      <p>This is because generative tools have proven effective in automating repetitive tasks such as code generation, debugging, and optimization. This increases productivity and improves accuracy in software development by accelerating the prototyping process and reducing syntactic errors, thus allowing developers to focus on design, architecture, and enhancing the user experience.</p>
      <p>Despite the advantages that AI presents for software development, it is essential to consider the limitations related to the generation of incorrect or inefficient code, understanding the context, and the ethical implications associated with the use of these tools. Therefore, it is necessary for developers to conduct a thorough review of the code provided by AI before implementation. Additionally, ethical aspects must be considered, particularly the risks that using these tools can pose for critical coding tasks. Utilizing code without understanding its functionality is an irresponsible act that can lead to security vulnerabilities, incompatibilities, and bugs. Furthermore, the constant use of Gen AI will hinder the programmer's ability to optimally develop their skills. Therefore, it is essential to learn how to balance the use of these tools to ensure that they do not replace understanding, but rather complement it.</p>

        <h2>Benefits and Limits of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
        <h3 class="author">By Asunción Peña</h3>
      </div>

    <div class="section-body">
      <p>Artificial intelligence has transformed the world and is now present in various areas of life, impacting us in either a positive or negative way. Therefore, it is important to recognize what benefits and limitations artificial intelligence may have in areas such as technology and its capabilities.</p>
      <p>One of the main benefits of artificial intelligence is task automation. As Chowdhury and Sadek (2012) state: "AI tools can facilitate faster decision making by automating the decision-making process. Through data gathering and screening, processing, and decision making, AI can support faster solutions to complex problems" (p. 6). This prevents us from having to use more time than necessary to complete a task or search for specific information, allowing us to use that time for other work.</p>
      <p>Likewise, artificial intelligence is a great help in different sectors such as education and healthcare. The accessibility of AI today allows students to quickly consult topics they don’t understand, guide them, and give them suggestions to improve their work. In healthcare, doctors use AI to quickly obtain information about a disease presented by the patient to make a diagnosis.</p>
      <p>However, artificial intelligence has its limitations, and one of them is that it is still not entirely efficient. As Chowdhury and Sadek (2012) state: "For gaining insight into the problem, the model may have to be rerun multiple times to assess the sensitivity of the solution to the various assumptions and parameters of the problem" (p. 7). That means the answers provided by the AI might not always be correct in solving our problem. To obtain a good solution, our prompts must be clear and specific. Another significant limitation is that emotional and abstract intelligence are still barriers for AI. Despite ongoing efforts in these areas, it will be difficult to reach the level of human emotional intelligence.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, artificial intelligence is present in many areas of life and has made our lives easier in many ways. While its benefits often outweigh its limitations, being aware of those limitations helps us use AI more responsibly and effectively. Understanding how far we can rely on it allows us to take advantage of its capabilities without overlooking the challenges it still faces.</p>

        <h2>Ethical implications</h2>
        <h3 class="author">By María Castro</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section-body">
      <p>Artificial Intelligence advances one step further every day, thanks to modern technology. It can be helpful in many areas, but as it gets more involved the ethics list grows further. Regarding ethics, it consists of moral principles about what is right and wrong. In addition to this, according to IBM (2024) AI ethics includes data responsibility and privacy, transparency, trust, the prevention of technology misuse, inclusion and accountability of the actions.</p>
      <p>Decisions made by AI systems can impact people’s lives deeply, for example today there exists the possibility of getting interviewed by a generated “person” for a job position, or the resumes can be read by a system and not a real person. This raises concerns about fairness and justice.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, accountability is a key ethical challenge. When an AI system causes harm or makes a wrong decision, it is not always clear who should be held responsible; the developers, the users or the AI itself. Therefore, developing transparent and trustworthy AI systems is crucial to ensure ethical compliance and public confidence.</p>
      <p>Since this happens mostly every day, it is important to follow ethical principles to guide the responsible development and use of AI. The International Business Machines Corporation (2024) states that in academic contexts, ethical guidance often relies on the Belmont Report, which highlights three main principles: respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. These principles emphasize the need for informed consent, the obligation to do no harm, and the fair distribution of both the benefits and risks of AI systems.</p>
      <p>All things considered, Artificial Intelligence continues to evolve rapidly, offering great potential while also raising important ethical questions. As AI systems influence more aspects of human life, it becomes essential to know, understand, and address concerns related to privacy, fairness, and accountability. Institutions like IBM provide this type of information and guides about responsible development. By following these ethical guidelines, society can ensure that AI technologies help optimize situations or actions in life while minimizing risks and preserving human dignity.</p>
